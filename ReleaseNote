Application Dependencies
========================
JRE 1.8
MongoDB 3.x
ActiveMQ 5.6.x
MySql 8.x

By default app refers to the :

- Active MQ - host:port  (localhost:61616)
- MongoDB  -host:port (localhost:27017)
- MySql    -host:port:usr:pass (localhost:3306:root:root)

#Aplication runs at 8280 port with embedded tomcat server inside the SpringBoot .

Refer Below documents for instalation and running steps of above dependencies in Docker :
ctiveMQInstallation.txt  MongoDBInstalation.txt MysqlDockerInstallation.txt

Note : For APP MySQL is optional .
===========================================================================

About Application BUILD Type  :
1.Its a SpringBoot Microservice with Maven as build environment and
JUnit 4.x and Mockito for Unit Testing .

App Configuration:
Application is capable of running with :
Default Configuration embedded with JAR in class path referred to by 
application.properties as main config to start .

/resources
	---application.properties (This is default properties file will be referred by application to Unit Test & Run)
	---logback.xml -- Log4j Configuration to generate the application log
main/java/com/poc/main/config
        -- application.properties  =>  ( Sample application.properties tells how you can externalize the most of the configuration stuff 
                      if you want to use this , can do it via calling SpringBoot Microservice by Command Line specifying the path )
        -- brokers.xml => Configuartion about AMQ broker Connectivity 
	-- appcontext.xml =>Entry Point XML of app to control the application flow to inject the beans.


TO Run the Application in Docker :
===================================
1) Go to the path where you kept the EventProcessingApp-1.0.0.jar in Dev machine
2) Copy Dockerfile here .
3) Run below Command to create the image in your docker machine :
  docker build -t meetingbooking .

4) Once Image installed successfully run below command (Ensure you have done with Installation of AMQ , MongoDB , MYSQL (optional along with table creation script & some commmands inside the MysqlDockerInstallation.txt )
docker run --net=host -p 127.0.0.1:8280:8280 --name eventprocessingapp -p 8280:8280 -t eventprocessingapp



To Run Application as simple command without docker  :
=======================================================

If your path of app running is :
/home/apps/EventProcessingApp/

then use below of command to run the Application:

java -jar /home/apps/EventProcessingApp/EventProcessingApp-1.0.0.jar

or [To let application refer external properties file instead of classpath properties]

java -jar /home/apps/EventProcessingApp/EventProcessingApp-1.0.0.jar --spring.config.location=file:/home/apps/EventProcessingApp/cfg/application.properties
